## Upgrade Packages

Since this is a test project, there is no point for using too old version of build env and leave out all of the newest features. So I decided to upgrade to the lastest version of NodeJS and ReactJS.

| Operation / Build Environment | Request Version | Applied Version |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Node.js                       | 16.13.1         | ^18.14.0        |
| npm                           | ^6.14.15        | ^9.3.1          |
| react                         | ^11.4.1         | ^18.2.0         |

## Planning

1. Setup the basic React project with create-react-app (0.5h)
2. Add TailwindCSS as CSS Framework for layout implementation (0.5h)
3. Layout the Main page with Header and Footer (1h)
4. Layout the Top Page (2h)
5. Layout the My Record Page (2h)
6. Layout the Column Page (2h)

Expected Time: 8h
